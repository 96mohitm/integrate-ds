## Goals of the library :

1. Reading any type of dataset file.
2. Statistical analysics of the data set.
3. Cleaning of the data-set.
4. Making all the different Models.
5. Evaluation of the different models.


I am using python 3.7

To create a virtual environment in anaconda

``` conda create -n integrate python=3.7 ```
